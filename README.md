# Garment_image_classification-and-Colour-Identification

CNN Model for garment classification. <br/>
KNN Algorithm is used for Colour Identification of garment images. <br/>
<br/>
Use Google Colab or Jupyter Notebook to run "Fashion_e_commerce.ipynb" code file. <br/>
Other folders or file should be saved in same directory and directory path should be changed according to the code.

For Colour Identification, use only given "preprocessed_for_colour_id.csv" for higher accuracy.

All the models are able to classifiy large dataset also. They need resizing and cropping so that only main object of image can be passed through CNN model.
